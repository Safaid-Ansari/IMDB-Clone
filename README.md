# IMDbClone

This is a complete Front-end based Project trying to replicate IMDb website. This project uses the TMDB API providing access to a huge database of Movies and their details.


Check Here : https://safaid-ansari.github.io/IMDB-Clone/index.html

The website has 3 pages

1. Homepage - Displays all recent and popular movies with a few options to play around with.
2. Movie Page - Displays details of a specific(selected by the user) movie with a button to play the trailer of the movie there itself.
3. My List Page - User can add movies to their favourite list. Those movies will be displayed here.
